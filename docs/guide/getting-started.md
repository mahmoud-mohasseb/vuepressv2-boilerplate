## Browser API Access Restrictions

Because VuePress applications are server-rendered in Node.js when generating static builds, any Vue usage must conform to the [universal code requirements](https://ssr.vuejs.org/en/universal.html). In short, make sure to only access Browser / DOM APIs in `beforeMount` or `mounted` hooks.

If you are using or demoing components that are not SSR friendly (for example containing custom directives), you can wrap them inside the built-in `<ClientOnly>` component:

```md
<!-- This will be kept as is by default -->

1 + 2 + 3 = {{ 1 + 2 + 3 }}
```

```md:no-v-pre
<!-- This will be compiled by Vue -->
1 + 2 + 3 = {{ 1 + 2 + 3 }}
```

```js:no-v-pre
// This won't be compiled correctly because of js syntax highlighting
const onePlusTwoPlusThree = {{ 1 + 2 + 3 }}
```
